//Assignment Description:  
//Write a program that reads the name and salary of an employee.  The salary will be an hourly wage, such as $9.25.  
//Ask how many hours the employee worked in the past week.  Be sure to accept fractional hours.  
//Compute the pay. Any overtime work (over 40 hours per week) is paid at one-and-one-half times the hourly wage (150 percent).  Print the employeeâ€™s name and paycheck amount.
