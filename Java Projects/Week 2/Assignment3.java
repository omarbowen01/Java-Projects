//Assignment Description: Input an integer number and compute the sum of the numberâ€™s odd digits.
//Write a program in which a while loop is used to compute the sum.
//For example, if the input is 32677, the sum would be 3 + 7 + 7 = 17.  The program will prompt the user to enter the integer and display the sum of all odd digits.
